# Task Completion Checklist

## Before Completing Any Task
Since this is a static site with no build/test infrastructure:

1. **Visual Check** - Open the site in a browser and verify changes look correct
2. **Cross-browser** - Test in multiple browsers if making CSS changes
3. **Responsive** - Check mobile/tablet views for layout changes
4. **JavaScript** - Open browser console, ensure no errors
5. **Links** - Verify all links and anchors work if modified

## No Automated Checks
- No linting configured
- No automated tests
- No build step to run
- No type checking

## Git Hygiene
- Keep commits focused and descriptive
- Current branch: `feature/keyboard-hero-section`
- Main branch: `main`
